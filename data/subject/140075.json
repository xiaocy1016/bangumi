    "第一部剧场版的逆转剧，感觉还挺乐",
    "再次认识到小马系列的人设是真的香，然而人设再香架不住剧情单薄",
    "当一个男生开始看这部作品，只能说明你真的看了太多小马了",
    "都看到这部了你已经差不多是个小马迷了",
    "补标",
    "其实并不是太喜欢人暮，我还带有马暮滤镜，看着有点干着急；不过比赛的片段做的挺好，且服装好贴好喜欢~~",
    "And it was right there in front of me. Just too close for me to see. Sometimes the things you want Are not the things you need. And it was right there in front of me!",
    "续接了上一部剧场版，感觉这一部pony紫悦基本上就没有了出场的意义，而且剧情上也没有什么出彩的地方，感觉一般般",
    "人暮也很萌啊，完全跟马暮一样。余晖主场~（有想打9分的冲动）",
    "不太喜欢人类暮暮，还是大师姐好啊。"
