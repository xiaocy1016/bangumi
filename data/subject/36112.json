  "summary": [
    "The show is set in the Stone Age town of Bedrock. (In some of the earlier episodes, it was also referred to as \"Rockville\"). In this fantasy version of the past, dinosaurs, saber-toothed tigers, woolly mammoths, and other long-extinct animals co-exist with cavemen. Like their mid-20th century peers, these cavemen listen to records, live in split-level homes, and eat out at restaurants, yet their technology is made entirely from pre-industrial materials and largely powered through the use of various animals. For example, the cars are made out of stone, wood, and animal skins, and powered by the passengers' feet (as in the theme song, \"Through the courtesy of Fred's two feet\")."
